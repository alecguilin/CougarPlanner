# CougarPlanner
Mobile Application (Android)

Group project for _CS 441 - Software Engineering_.

CougarPlanner is a personal planner with light social and sharing elements designed for students at our campus. Using the principles of sofware engineering, as a team we determined and documented the requirements of our system, then later determined and document our system’s architecture. Once we had determined these aspects of the project we implemented them, developing our project in the Android Studio IDE, using the Kotlin programming language and Google’s Firebase as a database/backend host. Our UI was built in XML that integrated with our Kotlin code. During our development we used Git as our method of version control via the GitHub web service and the Git dashboard program.
